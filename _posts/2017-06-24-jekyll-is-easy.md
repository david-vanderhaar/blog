## What is Jekyll?

So what is Jekyll anyway? It's a static website generator. It takes in your HTML, CSS, and Markdown files and it spits out a deployment-ready content for your personal, product or portfolio site.  

That's the most straight-forward answer. But the goodness of Jekyll isn't what it is, its what it can do for you as a developer. 

## Why use Jekyll?

As a developer you may be familiar with GitHub. If not, you will be soon! One of the great things about Jekyll is that once you generate your simple website, you are offered free internet space on GitHub. No need for servers or databases. Jekyll and GitHub allow you to push content directly into your online repository, automatically updating your entire website.

The other Jekyll win is that the community has created an abundance of awesome themes ready to be used for your own content. Many of these themes are free, and interchangable allowing you to try on a ton of different looks. Look at these examples:
