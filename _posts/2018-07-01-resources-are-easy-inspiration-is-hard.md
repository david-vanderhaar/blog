## The Easy Option

In each of these TIE-Love posts we identify two concepts in the title: one is easy for us to grasp or act on, the other is more challenging. As the title suggests, our two concepts are **resource gathering** and **inspiration**.

Gathering resources for your career or hobby in web development is a simple and powerful skill. Resources you gather such as articles, videos, presentations, and pdfs, and people are your collective North Star. They will always lead you back to inspiration, which is undoubtedly the harder thing to generate.

For this post we're breaking from the norm and reaching for the easy option, because gathering resources is vitally important for our productivity and creativity. The following is my current list of most valued resources.

### The Articles
